# EV CAN Bus Intrusion Detection System

This is my final-year project for my BSc Cybersecurity degree at Kingston University. In this project, I have developed a lightweight anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that detects cyberattacks on Electric Vehicle (EV) CAN bus networks using machine learning.

---

## Overview

Electric Vehicles (EVs) rely on the Controller Area Network (CAN) to allow different electronic components (ECUs) to communicate with each other. However, the CAN protocol lacks built-in security, making it vulnerable to attacks like message spoofing, denial-of-service (DoS), and fuzzing.

This project aims to design and build an IDS using Python that can analyze CAN traffic and detect anomalies in real-time using the Isolation Forest algorithm.

## Dataset

I used the **HCRL CAN Intrusion Dataset**, a publicly available dataset containing both normal and malicious CAN traffic. It includes four types of files:

- `Attack_free_dataset.txt` (normal data)
- `DoS_attack_dataset.txt`
- `Fuzzy_attack_dataset.txt`
- `Impersonation_attack_dataset.txt`

> Note: Due to GitHubâ€™s file size limitations, I havenâ€™t uploaded these dataset files here.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python (3.x)
- Google Colab (main notebook)
- pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- Isolation Forest (unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm)

## Methodology

I followed the CRISP-DM approach:

1. **Understanding the problem** â€“ Why CAN bus needs protection in EVs
2. **Data understanding** â€“ Loaded and explored the HCRL dataset
3. **Data preparation** â€“ Cleaned data and engineered useful features
4. **Modeling** â€“ Trained an Isolation Forest on normal data only
5. **Evaluation** â€“ Tested the model on attack data and analyzed results
6. **Documentation** â€“ Collected graphs and findings for final report

## Current Status

- [x] Dataset loaded and explored
- [x] Isolation Forest model implemented
- [ ] Evaluation graphs and metrics to be finalized
- [ ] Final documentation and GitHub polishing

## Results (To be added soon)

Once I complete the testing and visualizations, I will upload screenshots and evaluation metrics here.
